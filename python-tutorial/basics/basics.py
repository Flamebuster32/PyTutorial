# basic number operations
a = 90 + 20
b = 90 - 20
c = 6 * 9  # * means multiplication

liquid = ["w", "a", "t", "e", "r"]  # a list stores multiple variables(they dont need to be of the same type)
print(liquid)  # this prints the whole list
print(liquid[0])  # this prints the first value of the list (computers start counting from 0)
# tuples
# tuples work like lists except they cant be changed after their initiated
